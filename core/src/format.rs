/// A wrapper around a writer that performs indentation and fuses newlines.
///
/// Wraps a struct that implements `std::io::Write`. Implements `Write` itself and
/// adds methods to increase and decrease the indentation level, and to lazily
/// inject newlines.
///
/// The lazy injection of newlines is useful because it allows to fuse newlines from
/// consecutive blocks of text. For example, consider writing a paragraph of text
/// followed by a section header. We may want to have at least one blank line (i.e.,
/// two newlines) below a paragraph of text, and we may want to always have two
/// blank lines (i.e., three newlines) above every section header. Inserting these
/// newlines eagerly would result in an excessive 2 + 3 = 5 newlines (i.e., four blank
/// lines) above the section header. Instead, a `WhitespaceFormatter` fuses the
/// consecutive vertical space to just two blank lines:
/// ```
/// use bluepaper_core::format::WhitespaceFormatter;
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
///
/// let buf = Vec::<u8>::new();
/// let mut formatter = WhitespaceFormatter::new(buf);
///
/// // Write the paragraph of text without any newlines.
/// formatter.write_all(b"Some paragraph of text.").unwrap();
/// // Ensure that at least two newlines must follow the paragraph.
/// formatter.add_newlines(2);
///
/// // ... some more code that may or may not write more stuff ...
///
/// // Ensure that at least three newlines must precede the header.
/// formatter.add_newlines(3);
/// // Write the section header without any newlines.
/// formatter.write_all(b"## Section Header");
///
/// // Verify that exactly three newlines were written:
/// let s = std::str::from_utf8(formatter.get_ref()).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(s, "Some paragraph of text.\n\n\n## Section Header");
/// ```
